    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the safety to learn in a spiritual environment.  I am currently pursuing a BS degree.</p>
    <p>I like web design and so the benefit for me is learning this stuff now, I could always go work a web dev job if I lost my engineering job or just could not get a hold of a job I wanted. It's kinda like having a back up plan. This class is something usefull to know even in a full engineering job though like I have expirienced. They need to use private servers and make functional GUIs which let me tell you some don't know how to do it and I was one of those I have taken a few web dev classes now though, and not only are they fun but they are just so cool and useful.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life, and my favorite quote is by President Hinckley: "Forget yourself and go to work.".</p>
