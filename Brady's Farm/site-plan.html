			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This Website is a trial website I am making for my Father's animal farm business. He needs a website he can use to advertise his farm on and what animals are for sale to those looking to buy them. This project should be a basic advertisement website and allow customers to see what is for sell to contact my father and send him a small email with their information if they are interested.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience of this project will be focused of ranchers or farmers that need to buy animals such as cows or cow dogs even horses.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The Javascript should be able to allow more than one item to be entered in the Javascript and then populate as a list of items showing on page 2 of the site, with a picture and information of the animal.</p>
			<!-- change this -->
